## Summary

Liquidity in the market is not only a desirable feature from a trader's point of view, but also an important consideration from the risk-management standpoint. Position of a distressed trader can only be liquidated if there's enough volume on the order book to offload it, otherwise a potentially insolvent party remains part of the market.

Similarly to [price monitoring](0032-price-monitoring.md), we need to be able to detect when the market liquidity drops below the safe level, launch a "liquidity seeking" auction (in which, due to the [liquidity mechanics](./0044-lp-mechanics.md), there is an incentive through the ability to set fees, to provide the missing liquidity) and terminate it when the market liquidity level is back at a sufficiently high level.

Note that as long as all pegs that LP batch orders can peg to exists on the book there is one-to-one correspondence between the total stake committed by liquidity providers (LPs), see [LP mechanics](specs/0044-lp-mechanics.md) spec, and the total supplied liquidity. 
Indeed 
```
lp_liquidity_obligation_in_ccy_siskas = stake_to_ccy_siskas â¨‰ stake.
```
Thus it is sufficient to compare `target_stake` with `total_stake` while also ensuring that `best_bid` and `best_offer` are present on the book (*).
Note that [target stake](0041-target-stake.md) is defined in a separate spec.

(*) Having `best_bid` and `best_offer` implies that `mid` also exists. If, in the future, [LP batch orders](0038-liquidity-provision-order-type.md) are updated to allow other pegs then the protol must enforce that they are also on the book.

## Liquidity auction network parameters

**c<sub>1</sub>** - constant multiple for [target stake](0041-target-stake.md) triggering the commencement of liquidity auction.  

## Total stake

`total_stake` is the sum the stake amounts committed by all the LPs in the market (see [LP mechanics](specs/0044-lp-mechanics.md)) for how LPs commit stake and what it obliges them to do. 

## Trigger for entering an auction

The auction is triggered when
```
total_stake < c_1 x target_stake OR there is no best_bid OR there is no best offer.
```
Here 0 < c<sub>1</sub> < 1, to reduce the chance of another auction getting triggered soon after e.g. c<sub>1</sub> = 0.7. The parameter c<sub>1</sub> is a network parameter.

Similarly to [price monitoring](0032-price-monitoring.md), the auction should be triggered pre-emptively. That is, the transaction that would have triggered the liquidity auction should be [re-]processed once auction mode is on. Please note that this transaction may be cancelled if it's type is not valid for auction, however even in that case the market should still go into the auction mode to send a signal that it requires more liquidity.

## Trigger for exiting the auction

We exit if
```
total_stake >= target_stake AND there is best_bid AND there is best_offer.
``` 

During the liquidity monitoring auction new or existing LPs can commit more stake (and hence liquidity) through the special market making order type and enable this by posting enough margin - see the [liquidity provision mechanics](0044-lp-mechanics.md) spec for details. These need to be monitored to see if auction mode can be exit.

## What happens during the auction?

The auction proceeds as usual. Please see the auction spec for details.

## Test cases

* Market with no market makers enters liquidity auction immediately.
* Opening auction or price monitoring auction that would end with an uncrossing trade but no `best_bid` or no `best_offer` will enter liquidity monitoring auction.
