# Scenario Runner

Feature name: scenario-runner-cli
Start date: 2019-10-14

## Note

This spec is a work in progress at the moment, which is why it contains additional sections: [Possible future extensions](##Possible-future-extensions) and [Things to consider](##Things-to-consider-/-gotchas). Once we agree the requirements on [Guide-level](##Guide-level-explanation) these will get integrated into other sections or moved to a separate document and the [Reference-level explanation](##Reference-level-explanation) will get extended with implementation-level detail.

## Summary

Scenario runner is a broad term describing a tool or set of tools for exploratory testing and analysis of the Vega network. It's primary purpose is to support the stake holders in reviewing the mechanics of the protocol and mechanics generated by it.
It can also evolve into a tool allowing market simulation, backtesting of trading strategies or automated comparison of results obtained with the **trading protocol** running with different sets of configurations.  

In this spec we are focusing on `scenario-runner-cli`, a command line interface exposing the core functionality allowing the user to interact with the API components in an automated and reproducible way. The API calls and reposonses are to be handled by `trading-core` running without the consensus layer to assure maximum performance.

## Guide-level explanation

`scenario-runner-cli` is a command-line tool used for interacting with the instance of a Vega network. It can submit all the trading and collateral management-related instructions defined in the protocol. It interacts directly with the `trading-core` node running without Blockchain for maximum performance and throughput.

The main functionality is:

- `SubmitInstructions`: Reads a set of instructions from the `InstructionsFile` and submits them to the `trading-core`.
- `ExtractData`: Extracts the trading data from the node subject to additional, user-defined filtering and outputs it as a `DataFile`.

## Reference-level explanation

- `InstructionsFile` - supported data formats:
  - JSON
- `DataFile` needs to support further querying and slicing of data using generally available languages and tools. Suppored formats:
  - JSON
  - SQLite

### Architecture

- Where do we want to keep the code:
  - Seprate repo?
    - Cleaner.
    - Decoupled from the `trading-core`.
    - Less risk of introducing bugs to other parts of the codebase.
  - Folder within `trading-core/cmd`?
    - Will always be keep in sync with `trading-core`.
    - Code in `internal` accessible.

## Pseudo-code / Examples

## Test cases

- Check that the `SaveState` and `LoadState` functionality roundtrips
  - Take a saved state
  - Load it on a clean instance of the network
  - Save state
  - Check if the two `StateFiles` match

## Possible future extensions

- Add bots - the option to add trading logic which works algorithmically as opposed to reading a static set of instructions.
- "Diff" network states with SR (from David's spec: compare another pre-saved state of Vega with the one generated by the scenario
  This is for general regression testing / continuous integration.)
- Extend set of available commands to allow a more in-depth testing of the network (node failures etc.)
  (From David's spec: Run things across a network (or locally) but pretending we have several nodes (with consensus), that can be killed, re-started and poked with, ideally via a script.
  This is for more complex network interaction modelling of the whole network.)

- Include a backtesting framework to facilitate evaluation of investment strategies.
- Add a UI.

  - Adhere to conventions followed in the `client` repo so that the scenario runner UI can be used both standalone and as a component withing the main UI.

## Things to consider

- The concept of time
  - How do we inform the node of time?
  - Will need to distinguish between relative and absolute time.
  - We may want to translate something like an order expiring at 3.45pm today into an order expiring 3h from the base time of 12.45pm when we `save state`.
  - At the same time we may want to keep the maturity of the Dec19 futures contract fixed in absolute terms.
  - We will need a fairly flexible config file to accommodate both (and more).
- Deltas
  - Do we want to be able to `load state` onto existing network instance that already has a state (so more like `append state`)?
    - if we do then we will need to consider how we handle duplicate account IDs - e.g. there's already a "Trader1" account on a node that we're pointing out with a balance of \$1 and the state file contains the same account with balance $2 - do we want to end up with \$1,\$2,\$3? Do we want to assume any or control from config? - if so is that a setting for the `save state` or `load state` function?
- Config
  - Looking at previous points we may end up with a fairly complex config file.
    - Need to balance usability and flexibility.
      - Probably best to offer a set of predefined configs with sensible naming convetion and ability to customize them.
- Versioning
  - It's quite likely that we will end up adding more node instructions and/or modify the existing ones.
  - By that time we may already have a large collection of scenario runner `StateFile`s
  - Need to build in backwards compability or a way of updating them to the latest standard as considerable time and effort might have been put into generating some of them and the process might not be easy to reprodce (scrips that get lost or become stale, manual fine-tuning of certain values etc.)

##David's spec

### Requirements

At the very least we want to be able to:

- ~~run things locally on a laptop without a network connection (without consensus)~~
- ~~load state (price history, order book, every trader's position)~~
- ~~inspect the state of the Vega engine afterwards (e.g. all trader positions, their margin account amounts and~~
- ~~in a different mode let several bots trade and be able to observe state~~
  This is for quant / scenario testing.

Later for regression testing:

- ~~compare another pre-saved state of Vega with the one generated by the scenario
  This is for general regression testing / continuous integration.~~

Even later

- ~~Run things across a network (or locally) but pretending we have several nodes (with consensus), that can be killed, re-started and poked with, ideally via a script.
  This is for more complex network interaction modelling of the whole network.~~

Commands:

- Things that can push things into trading core
  - All of GRPC msgs to core
  - Movement of time or creation of extra blocks (needs additional things)
  - CSV / graph trans in file good for now
    - Make sure well defined so in future we can make version easily

Output

- What data are we expecting to expose from the core
