# Vega specs
This repository contains specifications and RFCs for future changes to the system. The process for writing, reviewing
and merging specs is in [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md).

## Specs
This folder contains the protocol specifications. The goal of this folder is to specify how anyone could write an
implementation of Vega that is compatible with [vegaprotocol/vega](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega).

## Non-protocol specs
For peripheral things that need to be hashed out through pull requests, we have `non-protocol-specs`. An example of
where this could be useful is the design process for the Liquidity Bots, or the short-lived 'training wheels' for a
limited mainnet.

## Releases
The canonical source for what features are going in to which release. Progress on these releases is tracked on 
[ðŸŽ± Release Board](https://github.com/orgs/vegaprotocol/projects/12).
